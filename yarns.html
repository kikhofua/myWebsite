          <h4>Preamble</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">The decision to participate in the MIT 6.148 Web Programming Competition was one of the best I have made. I considered other options, like taking a French class, or a Java programming class, amongst others but I settled on 6.148 for two main reasons. I liked the idea of having a project I could start and complete in a specified amount of time (4 weeks - the duration of IAP at MIT). I had also not participated in any competitions at MIT despite having done so in high school in the USA and in Nigeria.</p>

          <p class="left-align light">Although, I knew nothing about web programming at the time, I believed that I could learn quickly and could find two other people with whom to work with. I soon reached out to Rachel Simpson, my friend, and told her directly that I thought we could work well together; I had previously identified her as someone who is focused and does good work. Thankfully, she agreed to team up with me. But we needed a third member.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">At the end of the first 6.148 lecture, I went to join a circle of people without [complete] teams and bantered with several people before Hunter Gatgewood expressed interest in joining our team. He and I were the dates of two  girls in the same sorority. I had already deemed him a “cool guy” then so I was willing to work with him. Thus Team Nearly Okay was born.</p>

          <h4>Ideation</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">The theme for this year’s competition was “Remember the Future.” We were expected to come up with an idea that relates to the theme in some way or another and bring the idea to life in the form of a database-backed web app.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">In order to settle on an idea, we all three met and brainstormed ten ideas. Once we had our ten ideas, we went through each of them and briefly discussed their merits and pitfalls. We then sifted through them until we were left with Yarn.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">We chose to build Yarn because we noticed that for the majority of websites, people become consumers of content rather than creators. We set out to build a beautiful, user friendly web app that enables users to create content collaboratively while maintaining a low barrier to entry.</p>

          <h4>Creation (pt1)</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Armed with an idea that we all fully believed in, we set to work building our web app. We loosely divided tasks amongst ourselves, noting that we could exchange, join, or claim tasks when necessary. Nevertheless, I was primarily a front-end developer, Hunter was primarily a back-end developer, and Rachel was both a front-end and back-end developer.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Based on whiteboard sketches and discussions about what we wanted our app to be, we created wireframes for the <a href="https://wireframe.cc/PVSs54">home</a>, <a href="https://wireframe.cc/zeOQoD">user</a>, <a href="https://wireframe.cc/WaUiqS">find</a>, and <a href="https://wireframe.cc/CAs5oT">story</a> pages. We used those as references but we made changes as we gained a better understanding of what it was we were trying to build.</p>

          <h4>Creation (pt2)</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Later on, in the midst of building the back-end (we used MongoDB as our database, mongoose to organize schemas, and socket.io for message passing) we changed the name from Rolling Story to Yarn following Hunter’s strong preference for a one-word name. We all liked the name Yarn because we saw an opportunity to liken stories to balls of yarn which can be weaved with others to create something new and interesting.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">In response to the change in name, I created custom artwork around balls of yarn, spools of thread, and weaves. My drawings for the home page were based on pictures of real spools of thread and woven thread. The drawings for the find a story page were a combination of original drawings (mystery) and drawings that imitated stock images.</p>

          <h4>Creation (pt3)</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">As the deadline loomed large, my teammates and I worked together in a room for 17 hours straight in order to submit our fully functional application. There was a sense of achievement when we finished and could finally go to sleep at noon. Luckily, later that night we were informed that we’d been selected as semi-finalists.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">The following day, we presented our app to judges from Microsoft, Facebook, Palantir, Yext, and others. The next day was the award ceremony and we were to present our app to a large audience. I felt strongly that our home page needed something to bring it alive so I created a 10-second animation in Adobe Animate CC 2015 that consisted of a ball of yarn rolling across the screen while three birds, which represent my teammates and I flew overhead in the opposite direction.</p>

          <p class="left-align light">I worked through the night, slept briefly, and resumed work on it until 5pm, two hours before the awards ceremony. It took so long because it was my very first time using that particular application. But I persevered and was pleased with the final result. My teammates were pleased with it too and at the award ceremony, we were announced as 2nd place winners in the main division. We also won the Audience Choice Award which was given to the team with the most votes from members of the audience after a live voting session.</p>

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">6.148 was a wonderful experience for me. I learnt how to learn very quickly and find solutions to problems as they arose. I also learnt what it means to work with others on a project. From my experience, teamwork involves a good amount of give-and-take, especially when the team is trying to create something new and the project could go in many different directions.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">I learnt how to communicate effectively with my teammates, give constructive criticism about things I felt could be improved, and also to respond to criticism in a way that advances the team’s progress. For me, I believe effective communication is the key to achieving success when working in a team.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Overall, I would like to thank the organizers and sponsors for providing us with the opportunity to learn and create something new. The web programming skills I acquired have already added a lot of value to my portfolio (I used those skills to build this website).</p>
