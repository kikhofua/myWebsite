          <h4>Context</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Towards the end of the Fall semester, I noticed an email several days old inviting members of the class of 2018 to submit their designs for the Brass Rat T-Shirt that would be released at the Ring Premiere (the unveiling of the class rings otherwise called Brass Rats) later in the Spring. The designs were to be only for the front of the t-shirts.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">I immediately decided that I would take part in the contest. Two things motivated me to do so. First, I was excited to make use of my creative abilities after a semester-long hiatus from creating any new designs or artwork. Academic demands take up my time during the semester such that I do not exercise my imagination long enough to produce new artwork.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">Secondly, the reward for winning the contest was a gold ring. I knew that I could not afford to buy a gold ring (I would get the Ultrium version) so I decided to try to win one using design and creativity.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">However, I stumbled across the email late so I only had a few days before submissions were due. I was also in the midst of writing a difficult essay for my Technology and Innovation in Africa class. Nevertheless, I started brainstorming. I spent time after classes sketching many different ideas. For example, I had learnt about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_(discrete_mathematics)">Graph Theory</a> in my Mathematics for Computer Science class so I tried to create something based on the notion of connected nodes but I wasn’t satisfied with what I came up with. I continued sketching aimlessly until I stopped to actually think about who I was designing for and what I wanted the design to represent. It was then that I came up with this (pictured below).</p>

          <h4>Inspiration</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">Here was the description I included with my design for submission: "In imagining a design for the BrassRat T-shirt, I thought carefully about how to depict the class of 2018. I aimed to show a sense of togetherness and unity under one roof: MIT. I also wanted the design to be centered around a recognizable structure on campus. In addition the design needed to be elegant yet simple. The following informed my design:
          <br>1. Kresge Auditorium is among MIT’s most recognizable buildings. It has a unique structure that possesses what I like to describe as an “MIT-coolness factor.” Its roof is exactly one-eighth of a sphere. That fact caught my attention when on my first visit to MIT, a tour guide mentioned it. Thus I decided to make the connection between 1/8 and the class of ’18.<br>
          2. Furthermore, Kresge Auditorium and the MIT chapel were designed by renowned architect, Eero Saarinen (designer of the Gateway Arch in St. Louis), with the aim of expressing MIT’s social cohesion since these were buildings that would serve as places where students and faculty could congregate for formal events or special occasions. The inspiration for his designs matched my desire to depict a sense of togetherness amongst the members of the class of 2018.

          <h4>Inspiration pt.2</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">3. Once I settled on the design, I decided to continue the underlying theme of harmony by incorporating some of the design elements from the Brass Rat website. I used the same gold color from the website’s main logo and the same font (Montserrat) used for the header-texts.<br>
          4. I wanted the ‘2018' to be the main focal point in the design since my ideas were formed around thinking about how to depict our class so the words Brass and Rat had to go on either side of 2018. But this introduced the problem of asymmetry since ‘Brass' is a longer word than ‘Rat'. To restore balance to the design, I drew the outline of a standing beaver using a photograph I found online of the animal.<br>
          Overall, I enjoyed making this design. I believe it is elegant yet simple and it represents the class of 2018 and MIT in a positive way. I hope you like it.<br>
          Thank you.<br>
          PS: I am open to making changes based on your suggestions."

          <h4>Reflection</h4>
          <p class="left-align light">In the end, I did not win the contest. I later found out that my design was among the final three designs that were considered. Nevertheless, I was not discouraged. I was, and remain, proud of the design. The design contest reignited the creative spirit in me and served as a springboard for other projects I have since created.</p>
          <p class="left-align light">I also gained an appreciation for a theme/concept first approach to design where deep thought is first put into understanding one’s audience and message and allowing that theme/concept to inform one’s design. I am sure that there are other approaches to design but that approach worked well for me on this particular project.</p>
